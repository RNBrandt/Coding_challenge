# I created this Cleaner module and saved it in the lib folder for several reasons.
# 1) I used a module because none of the functionality requires instantiation, there is no reason to create multiple "Cleaners", and the modularity means it can continue to be improved and used in multiple classes as the project scales.
# 2) I saved it in the library because it clearly doesn't belong in the model, and I prefer the lib. to the helper files.

    #This and it's brother (change_sender), have caused me some consternation.  In the event that a sender/ or receiver is not properly input or formatted, I want to short circuit the attempt at saving a message.  The model won't allow it, neither will the 'send_message' method (which will throw an argument error if it gets there), so the integrity of the app is ok.  It's just unnecessary computing time. Unfortunately, I haven't found a good way to short-circuit that process,  send the user a useful message, and not break the entirety of the program/ testing setup.  Since it works very well as is, I'm going to leave it this way, but I'm curious how other engineers solve this.
